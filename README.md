## Objective
This assignment focuses on Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) principles in the
insurance domain. We will design and implement a simple insurance premium calculator
in Python using object-oriented concepts.
## Problem Description
An insurance company wants to develop a system that calculates premiums based on
customer demographics and policy types. The system should allow customers to inquire
about estimated premiums for different types of policies (e.g., health, auto, life) by
providing their information. Premiums are calculated using various risk factors such as age,
policy coverage, and other criteria.
